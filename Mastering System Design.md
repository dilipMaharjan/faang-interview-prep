## What is System Design?

### Definition

**System Design** is the process of architecting a software system to meet specific functional and non-functional requirements. It's about designing **scalable, reliable, maintainable, and efficient** systems that can handle real-world workloads.

> **Simple Analogy:** If writing a function is like building a single room, then System Design is like planning an entire building—considering electricity, water, ventilation, growth, and what happens if something breaks.

### What Makes Something a "System"?

A system is **more than just code**. It includes:
- **Hardware infrastructure** (servers, databases, load balancers)
- **Software components** (services, APIs, message queues)
- **Data flow** (how data moves through the system)
- **Reliability** (how it handles failures)
- **Monitoring** (observability, logging, alerting)

### Why Learn System Design?

#### **Build Systems Close to Perfect**
System Design is about creating systems that are:
- **Reliable** - They work when users depend on them (99.99% uptime, not 90%)
- **Fast** - Users get responses in milliseconds, not seconds
- **Scalable** - Can handle 10x, 100x, 1000x growth without breaking
- **Maintainable** - Other engineers can understand and improve it
- **Cost-efficient** - Use resources wisely (not 10x the servers needed)

When you skip system design, users suffer:
- Your system crashes during peak hours
- Pages take 10 seconds to load instead of 200ms
- A single bug brings down everything
- You need 10x more servers than necessary
- Adding new features becomes impossible

System Design is about **making deliberate trade-offs** between reliability, speed, cost, and complexity so your system doesn't collapse when it matters.
